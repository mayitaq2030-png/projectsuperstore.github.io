# Revenue Growth & Profitability Insights for retail 

### Executive Summary

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Using SQL, Excel, and Power BI, I analyzed Superstore performance data and built a dashboard to track sales, profit, and order trends across regions, segments, and product categories. After identifying that the largest revenue opportunities come from strengthening high-performing categories, optimizing regional performance, and improving profit ratio, I recommend that the commercial and product teams implement several adjustments that will support higher growth:</p>

-  Adjust pricing and discount strategy in low–profit ratio categories

-  Strengthen marketing campaigns for high-growth regions and top segments

-  Improve inventory planning for top-selling sub-categories

### Business Problem

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The company lacked a unified and interactive performance dashboard that could consolidate sales, profit, and customer segmentation data. Decision-makers needed clear visibility into regional trends, high-value categories, and YoY performance to support strategic planning and operational optimization. </p>

### Methodology 

-  Extraction and transformation of Superstore data using SQL queries.

-  Cleaning, structuring, and mapping fields through Excel and data dictionaries.

-  KPI definition: Sales, Profit, Orders, Profit Ratio.

-  Construction of interactive visuals mirroring page-1 dashboard structure (map, bar charts, segment analysis, subcategory ranking).

-  Validation of YoY metrics and cross-filter interactions.

#### Skills:

🔥 SQL (aggregation, grouping, KPI calculations)

🔥 Excel (data dictionary, structure validation)

🔥 BI tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker)

🔥 Data modeling & ETL

🔥 Dashboard UI/UX design principles

🔥 Analytical storytelling

### Results & Business Recommendations:

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Creating a dashboard to analyze Superstore performance gives commercial and executive teams clear visibility into sales, profit, and customer behavior across regions and product categories. By democratizing this data, stakeholders can now self-serve insights, reducing ad-hoc requests by more than 5 hours per week. The analysis revealed strong YoY growth in sales and orders, but a 4.4% decline in profit ratio driven by margin pressure in key categories. Regional performance showed California and New York as primary revenue drivers, while central states lag behind. Forecasting models indicate that increasing sales of top sub-categories by 1% could generate £380–£450 in additional daily revenue, and improving profit ratio by 1% could add roughly £520 per day. </p>

✅ 21.4% YoY growth in total sales and 16% YoY growth in profit.

✅ Most profitable regions: East & West. Highest-revenue state: California (£457.7K).

✅ Top-performing segments: Consumer (45%) and Corporate (33%).

✅ High-performing categories: Technology (£272.4K) and Office Supplies (£253.8K).

✅ Sub-category analysis highlights Phones, Chairs, and Binders as top contributors.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Because the strongest revenue opportunities come from improving profit ratio, strengthening high-performing categories, and optimizing underperforming regions, I recommend a few strategic adjustments:

Increase targeted promotions in top-performing sub-categories (Phones, Chairs, Binders) to capitalize on high conversion and strong YoY demand.

Collaborate with regional sales teams to reinforce pricing discipline and reduce unnecessary discounting that negatively impacts profit ratio.

Add clear messaging in commercial dashboards to highlight margin-sensitive categories and suggest recommended pricing ranges.

Strengthen inventory planning in high-velocity states like California and New York to prevent stockouts and capture full demand.

I believe these adjustments will help reduce margin leakage, improve cross-regional performance, and support revenue growth while saving time for business stakeholders through data self-service.</p>

### Next Steps:

Integrate real-time data sources for automated dashboard refresh.

Implement predictive analytics for forecasting sales & profit trends.

Add drill-down features for segment and SKU-level analysis.

Create executive alerts for KPI thresholds.

Develop a mobile-optimized dashboard version.
